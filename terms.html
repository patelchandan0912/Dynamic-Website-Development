<h1>Terms of Agreement</h1>
<div class="cont"><h2>Introduction:</h2></div>
<p><strong>TERMS OF SERVICE (TOS)</strong></p>
<p>These Acho Hosting Solutions Solutions Terms of Service (this " Agreement ") and Acho Hosting Solutions 's Acceptable Use Policy (" AUP ") govern your purchase and use of all Acho Hosting Solutions services (collectively, the " Services "), as described in the Order Form(s) submitted by you and accepted by Acho Hosting Solutions . You must register and accept the terms of this Agreement and the AUP in order to use the Services. BY CLICKING ON THE "I ACCEPT" BUTTON BELOW, AND/OR REGISTERING FOR AND USING THE SERVICES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT AND THE AUP AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AS WELL AS ALL POLICIES AND GUIDELINES OF THE AUP, WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. Acho Hosting Solutions may modify any of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and the AUP, at any time in its sole discretion. Any modifications are effective upon posting of the revisions on the Acho Hosting Solutions web site (the " Site "). Your continued use of the Services following Acho Hosting Solutions 's posting of any modifications constitutes your acceptance of the modifications. If you do not agree to the terms of any modification, do not continue to use the services and immediately notify Acho Hosting Solutions of your termination of this Agreement in the manner described in Section 1.2 below. </p>
<p><strong>Term and Payment for Services.</strong></p>
<p><span>Section 1.1 - Term.</span></p>
<p>This Agreement will be for an "Term" of 1 month from the date the Services are first provided by Acho Hosting Solutions . This Agreement will be automatically renewed (the " Renewal Term ") at the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term for a period of thirty (30) days unless you provide Acho Hosting Solutions with written notice of termination at least 30 days before the end of the Initial Term or Renewal Term, whichever is then applicable. To schedule your account for cancellation, If you do so wish to cancel your account or services you can do so by sending a email to support@acho-hosting.com with the subject line Account Cancellation. </p>
<p><span>Section 1.2 - Termination.</span></p>
<p>This Agreement may be terminated:</p>
<p>(i) by you or Acho Hosting Solutions during any Renewal Term, without cause, by giving the other party 30 days prior written notice;</p>
<p>(ii) by Acho Hosting Solutions in the event of nonpayment by you as provided in Section 1.4 below; and</p>
<p>(iii) by Acho Hosting Solutions , at any time, without notice, if, in Acho Hosting Solutions 's sole judgment, you are in violation of any terms or conditions of the AUP. If you terminate this Agreement, or if Acho Hosting Solutions terminates this Agreement for your breach, before the end of the Initial Term or the Renewal Term, whichever is then applicable, you will be required to pay immediately all fees and costs accrued before the termination date, all monthly recurring fees for each month remaining in the term and any other amounts you owe to Acho Hosting Solutions under this Agreement.</p>
<p><span>Section 1.3 - Charges.</span></p>
<p>You will pay all charges for your use of the Services at the then current Acho Hosting Solutions prices. You are responsible for paying all federal, state, and local sales, use, value added, excise duty and any other taxes assessed with respect to the Services, other than taxes based on Acho Hosting Solutions 's net income. </p>
<p><span>Section 1.4 - Payment.</span></p>
<p>You will pay all charges for the first month of service in advance on the first day of the Initial Term. You will pay all subsequent charges for Services in advance on the anniversary day of each month according to the then current price for the Services." You must pay for the Services by PayPal or credit card. You authorize Acho Hosting Solutions to charge your credit or debit card to pay for any charges that may apply to your account. You must notify Acho Hosting Solutions of any changes to your card account (including, applicable account number or cancellation or expiration of the account), your billing address, or any information that may prohibit Acho Hosting Solutions from charging your account. Your failure to fully pay any fees and taxes within 72 hours from the applicable due date is a material breach of this Agreement, justifying Acho Hosting Solutions to suspend its performance and terminate this Agreement. If Acho Hosting Solutions terminates for your material breach, you will be required to pay immediately all fees and costs accrued before the termination date, all monthly recurring fees for each month remaining in the term and any other amounts you owe to Acho Hosting Solutions under this Agreement. You are responsible for any costs Acho Hosting Solutions incurs in enforcing collection, including reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and collection agency fees. To reinstate Services, you must pay for 3 months of Service in advance on the first day such Services are reinstated and any fees associated with reinstating Services. </p>
<p><span>Section 1.5 - Refund and Disputes.</span></p>
<p>All payments to Acho Hosting Solutions are nonrefundable, unless you are in your first 30 days of hosting from the start of your initial term. This includes any applicable setup fees and subsequent charges regardless of usage. All overcharges or billing disputes must be reported within 60 days of the time the dispute occurred. If you dispute a charge to your credit card issuer that, in Acho Hosting Solutions 's sole discretion is a valid charge under the provisions of this Agreement and/or AUP, you agree to pay Acho Hosting Solutions an "Investigation Fee" of $100.00. </p>
<p><strong>Use of Services.</strong></p>
<p><span>Section 2.1 - Acceptable Use Policies.</span></p>
<p>The AUP governs the general policies and procedures for use of the Services. The AUP is posted on the site at (or such other location as Acho Hosting Solutions may specify) and may be updated from time to time. BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THE AUP AND ANY MODIFICATIONS TO THE TERMS. Acho Hosting Solutions MAY TERMINATE YOUR ACCOUNT WITHOUT NOTICE FOR ANY VIOLATION OF THE AUP OR THIS AGREEMENT. </p>
<p><span>Section 2.2 - Domain Names.</span></p>
<p>Upon registering your domain name, you are bound by the terms of the registration service's then current domain name policy and the policies of the national DNS registration authorities. Acho Hosting Solutions will not refund any fees you paid with respect to the registration of a domain name you are unable to use. All new webhosting accounts involving new domains will be set up and entered into our DNS servers within 3 to 5 business days. Due to unforeseen complications, however, this process may sometimes require up to 7 business days. If the new domain is registered by you, there will be no handling fee. If the domain is registered by Acho Hosting Solutions on your behalf a handling fee will be incurred. New webhosting accounts which involve the transfer of a domain from another provider to Acho Hosting Solutions will require a minimum of seven (7) days to be set up and entered into our DNS servers. In some cases, such transfers may take up to sixty (60) days. Due to the unpredictable nature of the transfer process, no guarantees are made regarding the amount of time a specific transfer may take. If the transfer of the domain is done by Acho Hosting Solutions on your behalf, a handling fee will be incurred. If you cancel service during the transfer period for any reason, all charges are considered earned.</p>
<p><span>Section 2.3 - Security.</span></p>
<p>You are solely responsible for any security breaches affecting servers or accounts under your control. If your Account is responsible for or involved in an attack on or unauthorized access into another server or system, Acho Hosting Solutions will shut it down immediately.
