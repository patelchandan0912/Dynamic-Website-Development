<p><strong>Adult Content on the Internet</strong></p>
<p>Acho Hosting Solutions will provide notification and will inform any customers in writing of improper materials on our servers. However, Acho Hosting Solutions reserves the right to disconnect any customers immediately. </p>
<p><strong>Commercial Advertisements with E-mail</strong></p>
<p>Acho Hosting Solutions takes a zero tolerance approach to the sending of Unsolicited Commercial E-mail (UCE) or SPAM over our network. Very simply, this means that customers of Acho Hosting Solutions may not use or permit others to use our network to transact in UCE. Acho Hosting Solutions is a self-managed environment, and it is the responsibility of Acho Hosting Solutions 's customers to ensure that no UCE/UBE is sent. Customers of Acho Hosting Solutions may not host, or permit hosting of, sites or information that is advertised by UCE from other networks. Violations of this policy carry severe penalties, including termination of service. Unsolicited commercial email (UCE) is defined by Acho Hosting Solutions as any electronic communication (e-mail, ICQ, IRC, Instant Messenger, pop-up ads via Windows Messenger Service, etc.) sent for purposes of distributing commercial information of any kind, soliciting the purchase or sale of products or services, or soliciting any transfer of funds to a recipient who has not agreed to receive such communication. Unsolicited bulk e-mail (UBE) is defined by Acho Hosting Solutions as any electronic communication (e-mail, ICQ, IRC, Instant Messenger, pop-up ads via Windows Messenger Service, etc.) to multiple recipients who have not agreed to receive such communication. Use of the Acho Hosting Solutions network, servers or services to transmit any unsolicited commercial or unsolicited bulk e-mail is expressly prohibited, as is hosting web sites or services on a server which are advertised in any UCE/UBE. Mailing lists must be true opt-in mailing lists. Before sending any email to a listed user, a confirmation email with a tracking number must be sent to the new subscriber, to which they must respond with a confirmation that they wish to be added to the list. You must keep these confirmations on file so that in the case that a spam complaint is made against you, you have proof that the user did indeed opt-in. In addition, you must provide at least one easy way to opt out; see the MAPS guidelines ( http://mail-abuse.org/rbl/manage.html ) for details. Opt-out requests must be honored immediately. Customers of Acho Hosting Solutions are strictly prohibited from using or permitting others to use UCE or SPAM over our network. As our Customers are ultimately responsible for the actions of their clients over the Acho Hosting Solutions network, it is advisable that Customers develop a similar, or stricter, policy for their clients. Violation of Acho Hosting Solutions 's SPAM policy will result in severe penalties. Upon notification of an alleged violation of our SPAM policy, Acho Hosting Solutions will initiate an immediate investigation upon receipt of the complaint. Upon notification, the customer has 24 hours in which to reply. During the investigation, Acho Hosting Solutions may restrict customer access to the network to prevent further violations. If a customer is found to be in violation of our SPAM policy, Acho Hosting Solutions may, at its sole discretion, restrict, suspend or terminate customer's account. Further, Acho Hosting Solutions reserves the right to pursue civil remedies for any costs associated with the investigation of a substantiated policy violation. Acho Hosting Solutions will notify law enforcement officials if the violation is believed to be a criminal offense. Violation of Acho Hosting Solutions 's SPAM policy may be reported to abuse@acho-hosting.com </p>
<p><strong>IP Address Overlap</strong></p>
<p>Acho Hosting Solutions administers the network on which customer servers reside. The customer cannot use IP addresses which were not assigned to them by Acho Hosting Solutions staff. Any server found using IPs which were not officially assigned will be suspended from network access until such time as the IP addresses overlap can be corrected. </p>

<p>Acho Hosting Solutions does not allow the use of IRC on the Acho Hosting Solutions network. This includes, but is not limited to, the use of IRC clients, server software, bots or anything related to IRC. Violators' servers will be suspended. </p>
<p><strong>Network Performance</strong></p>
<p>Acho Hosting Solutions accounts operate on shared resources. Excessive use or abuse of these shared network resources by one customer may have a negative impact on all other customers. Misuse of network resources in a manner which impairs network performance is prohibited by this policy and may result in termination of your account. You may not use network-intensive programs, such as peer-to-peer or audio/video streaming applications, which negatively impact other customers or the performance of Acho Hosting Solutions systems or networks. Acho Hosting Solutions reserves the right to terminate or limit such activities.</p>
<p><strong>Billing</strong></p>
<p>The customer understands that the customer is responsible for paying for any network resources that are used to connect the customer's server to the Internet. The customer may request that the customer's server be disconnected from the Internet, but the customer will still be responsible for paying for any network resources used up to the point of suspension or cancellation. </p>
<p><strong>Suspension</strong></p>
<p>Acho Hosting Solutions reserves the right to suspend network access to any customer if, in the judgment of the Acho Hosting Solutions network administrators, the customer's server is the source or target of the violation of any of the other terms of the AUPs or for any other reason which Acho Hosting Solutions chooses. If inappropriate activity is detected, all accounts of the Customer in question will be deactivated until an investigation is complete. Prior notification to the Customer is not assured. In extreme cases, law enforcement will be contacting regarding the activity. The customer will not be credited for the time the customer's machines were suspended. The Customer will be credited on a prorated basis based on the monthly fees the Customer pays for the servers that are suspended for the time the Customer's machines were suspended. </p>
<p><strong>Cancellation</strong></p>
<p>Acho Hosting Solutions reserves the right to cancel service at any time. If inappropriate activity is detected, all accounts of the customer in question will be deactivated until an investigation is complete. Prior notification to the Customer is not assured. In extreme cases, law enforcement will be contacting regarding the activity. All fees paid in advance of cancellation are non-refundable if Acho Hosting Solutions institutes its right of cancellation. Any violation of policies which results in extra costs will be billed to the customer (i.e. transfer, space etc.). </p>
<p><strong>Indemnification</strong></p>
<p>Acho Hosting Solutions wishes to emphasize that in signing the Master Services Agreement or its equivalent, customer indemnifies Acho Hosting Solutions for any violation of the Master Services Agreement or its equivalent, law or AUP that results in loss to Acho Hosting Solutions or the bringing of any claim against Acho Hosting Solutions by any third-party. This means that if Acho Hosting Solutions is sued because of a customer's or a customer of a customer's activity, the customer will pay any damages awarded against Acho Hosting Solutions , plus costs and reasonable attorney's fees. </p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer of Responsibility</strong></p>
<p>Acho Hosting Solutions is under no duty to look at each customer's or user's activities to determine if a violation of the AUPs has occurred, nor do we assume any responsibility through our AUPs to monitor or police Internet-related activities. Acho Hosting Solutions disclaims any responsibility for any such inappropriate use and any liability to any person or party for any other person's or party's violation of this policy. All Sub-Networks, resellers and managed servers of Acho Hosting Solutions must adhere to the above policies. Failure to follow any term or condition will be grounds for immediate Cancellation. <strong>INDIRECT OR ATTEMPTED VIOLATIONS OF THE AUPs AND ACTUAL OR ATTEMPTED VIOLATIONS BY A THIRD PARTY ON YOUR BEHALF, SHALL BE CONSIDERED VIOLATIONS OF THESE AUPs BY YOU.</strong></p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
